When something isn't working — your AI doesn't seem to use LeanCTX, savings are zero, recall broke, or a command behaves oddly — this is the central playbook. It runs symptom → one-line diagnosis → fix, tying together the repair tools scattered across the other journeys.

---

## 0. The 30-second triage

Run these three, in order. Each one's footer tells you the next step:

```bash
lean-ctx status                 # is the wiring there at all?  (5-line summary)
lean-ctx doctor                 # ~27 checks across binary/daemon/proxy/caches
lean-ctx doctor integrations    # per-IDE: MCP + hook freshness + rules, per agent
```

`status` is the fast yes/no, `doctor` is the deep scan, and `doctor
integrations` pinpoints *which editor* is mis-wired. Most problems below are
identified by one of these three and fixed by `lean-ctx setup --fix`.

---

## 1. "My AI isn't using LeanCTX at all"

**Diagnose:** `lean-ctx doctor integrations` — find the agent you're using and
read its line.

| What you see | Meaning | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Agent not listed | LeanCTX didn't detect it | `lean-ctx init --agent <name>` |
| `MCP config … missing` / `drift` | server not wired | `lean-ctx setup --fix` |
| `Hooks … drift` | shell hook missing/incomplete | `lean-ctx setup --fix` |
| `Hooks … stale binary …` | hook points at an old install path | `lean-ctx setup --fix` |
| All `✓` but still nothing | the **editor wasn't restarted** | fully quit & reopen the editor |

The last row is the most common: editors load MCP servers and hooks at startup,
so a config written after launch only takes effect on the next restart.

---

## 2. "`gain` shows zero / savings look wrong"

**Diagnose:** is anything routed through LeanCTX yet?

- A brand-new install legitimately shows *"No savings recorded yet — and that's
  expected."* Savings accrue only as the `ctx_*` tools and shell hook are used.
- If you've been working but `gain` is still empty, your terminal commands aren't
  being intercepted. Run `lean-ctx ghost` (hidden waste from uncompressed
  commands) and `lean-ctx discover` (missed-compression opportunities in your
  shell history) to confirm, then re-check the hook with `doctor integrations`.

`gain` and `token-report` read from the same stats store; if one shows numbers
and the other doesn't, you're looking at savings vs. memory footprint — that's
expected (see [Journey 11](/docs/journeys/analytics-and-insights/)).

---

## 3. "A new chat doesn't remember where we were"

Session auto-restore is failing. There's a dedicated repair tool:

```bash
lean-ctx sessions doctor          # diagnose session-restore health
lean-ctx sessions doctor --fix    # repair the latest-pointer / snapshots
```

Common causes: the project root changed (sessions are project-scoped), or
`sessions/latest.json` got out of sync. `sessions doctor --fix` rebuilds the
pointer. See [Journey 3 → Auto-restore](/docs/journeys/memory-and-knowledge/) for the
`ACTIVE SESSION` block this restores.

---

## 4. "Native Read/Grep are being denied"

This is **harden mode**, not a bug. If you (or a teammate) ran `lean-ctx harden`,
native file tools are intentionally denied so the agent uses the compressed
`ctx_*` tools. Turn it off with:

```bash
lean-ctx harden --undo            # native tools allowed again
```

See [Journey 13 → Harden](/docs/journeys/security-and-governance/) for what each level does.

---

## 5. "My shell is broken after install"

The shell hook or proxy modified your RC file. LeanCTX always keeps a backup:

```bash
lean-ctx doctor --fix             # re-runs the safe, merge-based wiring
lean-ctx proxy status             # is a *_BASE_URL export pointing at the proxy?
```

Every RC edit is preserved as a `*.lean-ctx.bak` sibling. If a base URL
"defaults to the wrong provider," check the exported `*_BASE_URL` values in your
RC and `lean-ctx proxy disable` to remove them. The emergency, no-binary fallback
is in [Journey 6 → Emergency](/docs/journeys/lifecycle-and-troubleshooting/).

---

## 6. "Search/indexing seems stuck or huge"

```bash
lean-ctx index status             # is each index ready + recent?
lean-ctx cache prune              # drop oversized/quarantined/orphaned indexes
```

If `index status` shows a very old build time, the watcher isn't running —
`lean-ctx index watch` (or just `setup --fix`) restarts it. If the BM25 index is
quarantined, `cache prune` removes it and the next read rebuilds it. To bound
index size proactively, see [Journey 14 → Performance](/docs/journeys/performance-tuning/).

---

## 7. "After `lean-ctx update`, an editor stopped working"

`lean-ctx update` automatically refreshes every installed shell-hook agent so
its hooks point at the *new* binary. If one agent slipped through:

```bash
lean-ctx doctor integrations      # look for `stale binary` on the affected agent
lean-ctx setup --fix              # re-point all hooks at the current binary
```

The set of auto-refreshed agents is maintained internally; MCP-only agents need
no hook refresh because they always run the current binary directly.

---

## 8. When all else fails — capture a report

```bash
lean-ctx report-issue             # collects a redacted diagnostic bundle
```

This gathers `doctor` output, versions, and config (secrets redacted) so a bug
report is actionable. Pair it with the exact command and the editor you used.

## Decision guide

| Symptom | Start here |
|---------|-----------|
| Agent ignores LeanCTX | §1 → `doctor integrations` |
| Zero/odd savings | §2 → `ghost` / `discover` |
| New chat has no memory | §3 → `sessions doctor --fix` |
| Read/Grep denied | §4 → `harden --undo` |
| Shell/proxy broken | §5 → `doctor --fix` / `proxy status` |
| Search stuck/huge | §6 → `index status` / `cache prune` |
| Broke after update | §7 → `doctor integrations` / `setup --fix` |
| Need to file a bug | §8 → `report-issue` |
